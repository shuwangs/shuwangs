# 👋 Hi, I'm Shu Wang! 😺

I'm a Junior Software Engineer and Bioinformatics Scientist with a passion for writing clean, efficient code to solve real-world problems. I currently work full-time in scientific computing while pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

This GitHub is where I showcase my software and data-driven projects — built with curiosity, tested with rigor, and always evolving. 💻🌱

## 📘 Background

My expertise spans across:
- 🧱 Backend logic, APIs, and database design
- ⚙️ Software engineering principles and system design
- 🧬 **Bioinformatics** & scientific computing
- 📊 **Data analysis**, reporting, and visualization
- 🤖 **Machine learning** and statistical modeling

I enjoy building tools that are not only functional but also scalable, readable, and well-documented.

## 🐱 About My Cat

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, I’m usually hanging out with my cat **Bobo**, who’s taken his role as my “pair programmer” very seriously — especially when I'm debugging 🐾
