# 👋 Hi, I'm Shu Wang! 😺

I'm a **Bioinformatics Scientist** and **Machine Learning Enthusiast**, currently working full-time as a Data Analyst & Bioinformatics Scientist, while pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science.

I'm in the process of **transitioning into a Software Development Engineer (SDE) role**, and this GitHub is where I document that journey — project by project, line by line. 💻🌱

## 🐱 About My Cat

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, I’m usually hanging out with my cat **Bobo**, who’s taken his role as my “pair programmer” very seriously — especially when I'm debugging 🐾
